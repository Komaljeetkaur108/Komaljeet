# Komaljeet
I am a Data Science and Machine Learning student at NorQuest College with hands-on experience in building and deploying machine learning projects. I enjoy working with real-world data and turning it into useful insights.

Through my coursework and projects, I have gained experience in data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. I have worked with tools such as Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Streamlit, and Flask.

I am especially interested in applied machine learning and data-driven decision making. I like learning by building projects and improving them step by step. I am motivated to continue growing my technical skills and preparing for industry roles in data science and machine learning.
